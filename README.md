## Project Information

### Project introduction: MyStore

This project is a simple Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process. The application uses Angular's built-in'.

#### Before you begin

Throughout the course, you've learned a lot about Angular components, services, modules, services, routing, and data flow:

* Fetching data from an API using Angular's HttpClient module.
* Learn how to use hierarchical component structure, including child components and nested components.
* How to collect user input and validate it to ensure that the user's actions are accurate and complete.
* Event and event handling in Angular to dynamically update the UI based on user actions.
* Using model-driven forms in Angular to ensure that the user's input is accurate and complete.
* Passing data between sibling or otherwise "unrelated" components.
* Setup routing to allow users to navigate between different pages of the application.

#### Project features

Your application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
